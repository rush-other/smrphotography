<center><h1>Current Project</h1></center>
<div class="paragraph">
<p class="justified">
My current project is a portrait book featuring vegans.  My goal in this creative endeavour is to show the diversity in our vegan community and to reveal a bit about each individual vegan through dialogue and thoughtful portraiture.
</p>
<p class="justified">
Portrait of a Vegan is currently moving from Portland to Los Angeles.  Photo shoots in the Los Angeles area will begin in Summer 2008.

<center><b>Project FAQ</b></center>
<p class="justified">
1.	<b>I am a vegan interested in participating.  What do I need to do?</b>
</p>
<p class="justified">
<%=link_to "Contact me", :action=> "contact", :format=> "html" %> so we can figure out the when and where for your portrait to be taken, and fill out a questionnaire sometime before we meet.  That's it!
</p>
<p class="justified">
2.  <b>Where and when will my portrait be taken?</b>
</p>
<p class="justified">
I'm interested in showing you in the location that you feel is your "natural habitat" - where you feel the most you.  This can be your home, your work, your gym, or at a location where you do a favorite activity (hiking, skiing, surfing, writing, drinking coffee, etc.)</br>
</br>
The location is completely up to you and we'll work together to schedule a date and time.
</p>
<p class="justified">
3.  <b>What should I wear?</b>
</p>
<p class="justified">
Wear whatever you think says "You."  Please don't dress up in your special occasion clothes - Remember, I am interested in showing you in your "natural habitat."
</p>
<p class="justified">
4.  <b>What information will I need to provide?</b>
</p>
<p class="justified">
The questionnaire has several questions and will be provided to you well before your portrait is taken (via email or snail mail) so you can complete it at your leisure.</br>
</br>
Feel free to skip the questions you don't feel like answering, but I hope you will respond with wonderfully insightful comments to at least a few - it will make for a much more interesting book!
